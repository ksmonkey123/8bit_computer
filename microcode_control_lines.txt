INPUT SIGNALS:
 * bits 0-7: instruction register
 * bit 8: zero flag
 * bit 9: negative flag
 * bit 10: carry flag
 * bit 11: <unused, must be low>
 * bit 12: cycle (0 during fetch, 1 during execute)

FETCH CYCLE:
 * bits 0-1: fetch size (0/1/3)
 * bit 2: new carry flag value (relevant only if bit 3 is set)
 * bit 3: update carry flag? (update carry if set)
 * bits 4-7: ALU command (4 bits)

EXECUTE CYCLE:
 * bit 0: memory write
 * bit 1: register write (register addressing from bits 0-1 from instruction register)
 * bits 2-4: read control
    > 0xx: read disabled (bus pulled low)
    > 100: read memory
    > 101: read registers (addressing from bits 2-3 from instruction register)
    > 110: read literal
    > 111: read ALU
 * bit 5: feed address bus from register (if low, feed from literal; only relevant for execution cycle)
 * bit 6: branch (set programm counter from address bus)
 * bit 7: <unused>
