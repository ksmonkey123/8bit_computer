A register is a circuit that can store and recall a multi-bit value.

Besides the general store and recall the internally stored value can also be exposed over other paths. A second driver IC can expose the stored value to a secondary data bus.

If another circuit needs permanent access to the stored value, the output pins of the flip-flop can also be directly exposed to a matching [[Interlink Bus]].
