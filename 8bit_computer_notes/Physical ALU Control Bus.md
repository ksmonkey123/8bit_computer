The [[Physical Bus]] primarily controlling the [[ALU]] operation.

|  Pin | Function                   |
| ---: | -------------------------- |
|    1 | ALU command bit 0          |
|    2 | ALU command bit 1          |
|    3 | ALU command bit 2          |
|    4 | ALU command bit 3          |
|    5 | $writeALU_{IN}$            |
|    6 | $\overline{readALU_{OUT}}$ |
|    7 | $F_C$ (sent by ALU)        |
| 8-16 | N/C                        |
