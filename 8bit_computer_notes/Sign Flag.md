The sign flag ($F_S$) indicates that the last value that was passed over the [[Data Bus]] was negative. A value is considered negative if the most significant bit is set.

The sign flag can be safely ignored when working with unsigned data, it simply facilitates interaction with signed data.

The sign flag is always updated together with the [[Zero Flag]].
