The _Action Selector_ is a 5-bit [[Microcode]] parameter. It controls the [[ALU]] and additional actions.

>[!warning]
>Because the action selector manages both ALU operations and write operations from the address bus, it is not possible to perform ALU calculations in the same step as an address write.

>[!Hint]
> The action codes in the range $[10001_2, 10111_2]$ are currently unused. These are designed to be used for future features in the instruction execution. These signals are produced by the [[Instruction Decoder]]
> Features that interact primarily with infrastructure components like the [[Instruction Register]], the [[Main Clock]] or the [[Step Sequencer]] should use the range $[11001_2, 11111_2]$. These signals are not produced by the instruction decoder.
