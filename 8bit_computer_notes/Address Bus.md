The address bus is a 16-bit bus primarily used to provide a [[Memory Address]] to a [[Memory Device]] for instruction fetching ([[Fetch Phase]]) or for data access ([[Execution Phase]]).

The device writing to the address bus is selected by the [[Address Source]].

> [!info]
> The value on the address bus is written to the [[Increment Unit]] on every step automatically.

>[!hint]
>Since all possible address sources are well-defined, there is no need for pull-ups or pull-downs.
